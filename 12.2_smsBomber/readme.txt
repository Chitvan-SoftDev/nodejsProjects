this project is basically made using webscrapping and automation..
n.p.m libraries used in this are puppeteer and prompt-sync …
In this I basically used websites which asks for otp for authentication purposes …..
I automated this and for now I used five such websites which are:
Byjus.
Swiggy.
Nados.
Faasos.
Jiomart.
Firstly it will ask “What is phone number you want to get bombed?”…
And then it will open the sites one by one and type the number automatically and ask for an otp….
And the otp is sent to mentioned phone number….
