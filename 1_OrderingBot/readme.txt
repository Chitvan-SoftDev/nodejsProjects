this project is basically made using webscrapping and automation..
n.p.m libraries used in this are puppeteer and inquirer …
In this I basically used jio mart website to order the daily used items ……
This provides you a very interactive command line interface to order your daily use items…
Firstly it will give you 4 categories for your daily use items which are……..
Fruits and vegetable.
Premium fruits.
Dairy and bakery.
Staples.
You have to select one you want to order from…..
Then it will provide you list of items in that category …
You can choose items one by one by selecting them….
And if you want more items from same category select “go back to previous menu”…..
Or if you want to go to the category menu select ”go back to main menu”……
Else if you find that you don’t wish to add more elements in your cart you can select “exit and 
proceed to checkout” ………..
this option will open your cart in browser and then you can checkout and select “payment and
delivery options” manually……..
